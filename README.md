curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "john@company.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Use token in protected requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/leave-requests/my-leaves \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
